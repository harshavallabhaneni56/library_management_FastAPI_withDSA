DB Browser for SQLite: Allows the users to view the database via a graphical user interface. It is used to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

Postman: An API platform for building and using APIs.

FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

SQLite3: File-based SQL database used to integrate the SQLite database with Python.

SQLAlchemy: Facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases. It provides a set of high-level API to connect to relational databases.

Uvicorn: An ASGI server that lets you run your FastAPI applications. It serves as a foundation to run your FastAPI instance.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. In the context of the provided code, SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM.
